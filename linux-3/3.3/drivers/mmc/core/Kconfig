config MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
	bool "Assume MMC/SD cards are non-removable (DANGEROUS)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will assume that all cards
	  stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The
	  normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and
	  redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will
	  in most cases result in data corruption.

	  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use
	  a MMC/SD card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.

	  This option sets a default which can be overridden by the
	  module parameter "removable=0" or "removable=1".

config MMC_CLKGATE
	bool "MMC host clock gating (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This will attempt to aggressively gate the clock to the MMC card.
	  This is done to save power due to gating off the logic and bus
	  noise when the MMC card is not in use. Your host driver has to
	  support handling this in order for it to be of any use.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_FORCE_NO_1V8
	bool "Force no support for 1.8V MMC operation"
	help
	  Do not attempt to use 1.8V mode on cards that claim to support. Use this if
          you know your hardware does not support 1.8V but you controller may claim it does..

          Note that this flag will prevent UHS cards operating in UHS mode.
